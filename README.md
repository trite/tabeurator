# Tabeurator

## Resuming:

still need to get the previous tab shortcut to work with it and doesn't yet capture when moving to a window without also changing tabs, which kind of messes with the goal of last tab meaning last tab viewed (focused)?

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out better fuzzy search settings, there's lots to work with but just need to sit down and take the time
- [x] Jump to previous tab via shortcut
- [ ] Change filtering in search box on the fly via keyword or key character
- [ ] Check Fuse.js docs to see if there's any option for things like hard filtering
  - [ ] Might be something [here](https://www.fusejs.io/api/options.html#useextendedsearch)
- [ ] Will the current method have issues when tabs are reordered? Might need to see if there's a unique ID that follows tabs around when they are reordered.

## Maybe

- [ ] Jump to X tabs ago via shortcut (limited by the MRV list length, only available if MRV is enabled)
